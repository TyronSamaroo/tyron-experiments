# 🧪 Tyron's Experiments

A collection of fun, experimental, and learning projects that don't warrant their own repositories.

## 📁 Projects

### 🚀 [Coding Dashboard](./coding-dashboard/)
A fun CLI tool to track your coding progress with beautiful ASCII art, session timers, and motivational quotes.

**Tech Stack:** Python, pyfiglet, colorama, uv

*More experiments coming soon...*

## 🚀 Getting Started

Each project has its own README with specific setup instructions. Most Python projects use `uv` for dependency management:

```bash
# Navigate to any project
cd project-name

# Install dependencies and run
uv run main.py
```

## 📝 Adding New Projects

1. Create a new folder with a descriptive name
2. Add a README.md explaining what the project does
3. Update this main README with a link to your new project
4. Follow the existing project structure

## 🎯 Project Guidelines

- Keep projects **lightweight** and **focused**
- Include a **README** with setup instructions
- Use **modern tooling** (uv, poetry, etc.)
- Make it **fun** and **educational**
